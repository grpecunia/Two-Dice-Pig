<h1>Two Dice Pig Game</h1>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)'>Pig</a> is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.</p>

<p>Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score (e.g. Pig, Pass the Pigs, Cosmic Wimpout, Can't Stop). In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it.<p>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
** In each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold" their score:

This variation is the same as the legacy Pig Game, except:
<ul>
<li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.</li>
<li>If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.</li>
<li>If two consecutive 6s are rolled on the same dice, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.</li>
</ul>
